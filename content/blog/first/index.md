Welp, i am sure this is bout to get interesting, been trying to get into tech writing for a while and things like tech stack,choice of frameworks,day commitments made me push it off for sometime.
One day,i came across the simple amazing blog [overeacted.io](https://overreacted.io/) of the equally amazing [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) i had a hunch that it would be of the JAMStack.

Imagine my surprise when i learnt of a entire site generator  based on my fav framework React, i was sold immediately. If you had guessed already , yes this was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

#### But why a blog?

_Is it a blog though_ ! I wanted a place to jot down my thoughts and i have been doing that in Notepad since forever  and most of the time i forget what i learnt and nothing is worse than forgetting your **Aahaaa** moments :( 

So this is an attempt to digitally preserve my learning and pass it on to the community so to speak. Visitors, pardon my grammatical skills and n00b thoughts.

Lets roll!
