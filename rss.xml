One day,i came across the simple amazing blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://overreacted.io/&quot;&gt;overeacted.io&lt;/a&gt; of the equally amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_abramov&quot;&gt;Dan Abramov&lt;/a&gt; i had a hunch that it would be of the JAMStack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise when i learnt of a entire site generator  based on my fav framework React, i was sold immediately. If you had guessed already , yes this was built using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But why a blog?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it a blog though&lt;/em&gt; ! I wanted a place to jot down my thoughts and i have been doing that in Notepad since forever  and most of the time i forget what i learnt and nothing is worse than forgetting your &lt;strong&gt;Aahaaa&lt;/strong&gt; moments :( &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is an attempt to digitally preserve my learning and pass it on to the community so to speak. Visitors, pardon my grammatical skills and n00b thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets roll!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
